After 30 years of Windows machines, labs, and various jobs teaching Windows products and building/maintaining
Windows networks, I had enough.  My first Linux PC (June 2023) was Ubuntu Budgie. Hopping from Pop!, Debian, Sid,
Trixie, Neon, Open Suse Tumbleweed, Arco and various other distros and DEs, I ended up with Fedora Hyprland
and Budgie. Hyprland is as much fun I have had with a PC since playing with Cartridge BASIC on a IBM PCjr.
